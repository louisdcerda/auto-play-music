# PERSONAL PROJECT: scheduled music player

This project was an exploration into automating processes in my life. I created this system by pulling my data 
from Spotify's API, connecting my laptop's bluetooth to my speaker's 
bluetooth and adding a cron job that would allow it to be scheduled at a desired time.
